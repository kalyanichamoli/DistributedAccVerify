Though during this tough time of covid, lot many volunteers without caring about their life are helping others,

There are some monsters who are sucking blood and money of needy people. 

In any of country at time of any calamity it always happens. 

This is some very basic POC code to demonstrate how validation can be done without loading a central point.

This is attempt to minimize thug attack from group of people where such people work in herd and one person post
on twitter and share details of some person and other 4 retweets same by saying verified at XYZ time.

Some of my known were duped by this trick so just thinking that something has to be done. 

I understand that though it's not foolproof but I still feel that would be a good start and if we are able
to minimize or even able to stop couple of such attempt than would consider worth of making efforts in this direction.

I assume here to general person have some basic knowledge of urls and understand that which urls are legit.

It can further add more info for signature to make it tougher for person to fake his/ her validation.



Thanks for reading all this.
